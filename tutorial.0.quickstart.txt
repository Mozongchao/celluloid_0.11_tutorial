################################################################################

Celluloid is an R package to estimate ploidy and cellularity from sequence
data derived from tumours.  (?)
Read INSTALL.txt for instructions on how to install celluloid.

################################################################################
INPUT FILES

Input files used in the tutorial are included in the Data directory. Unzip 
before use. 

The main input files are .wig files that are needed by the HMMcopy package.  

See http://compbio.bccrc.ca/software/hmmcopy/ for instructions on how to turn 
traditional bam sequence files into wig files, including wig files for gc- and 
mappability-related data.  Here the files normal.wig, tumour.wig, gc.wig and 
map.wig contain more than the standard chromosomes. However, only the autosomal
chromosomes are used in deriving ploidy (autosomal ploidy) and cellularity. 

The file AR.txt contains the columns:

CHR POS REF_COUNT VAR_COUNT
chr1 754730 31 17
chr1 754813 10 23
chr1 754840 30 10
chr1 754873 16 20
chr1 755955 26 14
...

where each line corresponds to a heterozygous position in the normal tissue.
REF_COUNT represents the number of reads supporting the reference
allele in the tumour, and VAR_COUNT represents read counts supporting the
other allele.  The header line is required.

RUNNING THE PROGRAM

As an overview of how to use the package, run the pipeline.r script, which
performs an analysis assuming one clone is present. To run the script, from 
the main celluloid directory, call from the command line (make sure to gunzip 
the Data files first):

Rscript pipeline.r Data/tumour.wig Data/normal.wig Data/gc.wig Data/map.wig Data/AR.txt samplename

All data objects will be saved as .rda files in a directory called RdaPipeline.
The file contour_solutions_samplename_1.pdf will also be created.

Details of each data preparation step are found in 

 tutorial.2.load_and_show.txt

The analysis uses the segment-based objective function, further described in 

 tutorial.3.select_and_search.txt

The value of this objective function is an ad hoc measurement of the weighted
fraction of the tumour genome that is captured by the model, defined by values
of ploidy, cellularity and subclonal proportions. Another objective function,
suited for manual interventions, is also described in the above tutorial file. 

The search is done by a call of the function coverParamSpace.

Local maxima of the objective function are found by using the optim() function 
in R with 50 randomly chosen starting points.  
 
Local solutions are found in a graphical output. See file 

 Figures/contour_solutions_samplename_1.pdf

The first panel represents the values of the objective function as a function of
the parameter n (the percentage of normal cells in the sequenced sample). This 
is to help the user judge if the parameter space was well covered. 

Then local solutions are shown in a series of contour plots. The x-axis 
represents the (scaled) read counts in tumour segments, and the y-axis 
represents values for the allelic ratios (proportion of reads supporting the 
reference allele) evaluated at germline heterozygous positions in those 
segments. White dots in the graphs represent actual segments. 

The red dots and lines represent the integer copy-number states and allelic 
ratios that are predicted given the estimates of tumour ploidy and cellularity. 
The value of the objective function at the local solution is displayed on the 
top left corner. 

Details about the figures can be found in 

 tutorial.4.display_solutions.txt

In pipeline.r, coverParamSpace makes use of a dimension reduction trick (by 
setting a value to the argument Sn), because cellularity and ploidy are 
interconnected. A first step of this trick consists of estimating "LOH curves", 
which may fail in practive in some datasets, in which case manual interventions 
may be required. The LOH curves represent the lower and upper values of the AR 
expected in regions of LOH, given the copy number state of the tumour in those 
regions. These LOH curves are the two symmetrical black curved lines on the 
output graphs. See the "OTHER OPTIONS: Sn" section in 

 tutorial.5.other_options.txt

The user must decide on a solution based on experience, and copy-number 
segments can then be plotted:

library(celluloid)
files<-system("ls RdaPipeline/*rda",intern=T); for(f in files){load(f)}
prepCN(12,1,NULL)
ePP<-ePeakPos( S=0.624, t=c(0.073, 0.923), cn=cn  )
tcs<- scaleReadCounts( tc , ePP )
segments<-scaleSegments(t.ar.seg ,  ePP )
segments<-annotateSegments(segments, ePP)
plotSegment( tcs,segments, ar , file="segments_page%1d",device="png",
             width=960,height=1320, cex.axis=2, cex.main=2, cex.lab=2, 
             type="cairo" , tlwd=8 ) 
# XY chromosomes can't be annotated due to lack of ar
segmentsXY<-scaleSegments(t.seg ,  ePP )
plotSegment( tcs,segmentsXY, ar=NULL , file="segments_pageXY",device="png",
             width=960,height=1320, cex.axis=2, cex.main=2, cex.lab=2, 
             type="cairo" , chr=c("chrX","chrY") , tlwd=8)
